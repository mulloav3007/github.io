%% Model solving--a brief description of commands
% Command 'model' reads the text file 'model.mod' (contains the model's

% 'p' (see readmodel) and transforms the model for the matrix algebra.
% Transformed model is written in the object 'm'.

m = model('minimep0.model', 'linear=', false, 'assign', p);

% Command 'sstate' takes the transformed model in object 'm', calculates the model's
% steady-state and writes everything back in the object 'm'. Typing 'mss' in
% Matlab command window provides the steady-state values.
